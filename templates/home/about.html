                <p>Hello and welcome to my little web app!</p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    This is supposed to be a journalism-style website in which
                    you can submit articles for review, tag articles, comment, like
                    or dislike articles and manage your personal profile.
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The article content of this site support the 
                    <a class="markdown-link" href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">
                        MarkDown Markup Language
                    </a> 
                    but keep in mind that the available tags are:
                </p>
                <p class="available-tags">
                    'p', 'b', 'strong', 'em', 'ul', 'ol', 'li', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6', 'pre', 'code'
                </p>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    I also built my own <a class="api-link" href="{% url 'swagger-ui' %}" target="_blank">REST API</a> which allows for anyone to 
                    dynamically fetch articles programatically! No key needed!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main idea for making this project was seeing if 
                    I could develop a realistic web application with user privileges,
                    moderation and custom logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its a culmination of techniques I learned through lectures,
                     studies, and my own experimentation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since im also hobby-watching a lot of scripting and cybersecurity
                    content I made sure to include a lot of checks in my code and custom
                    scripts for various purposes.

            <h1>About the developer</h1>
            <div class="dev-info-text">
                <p>My name is Plamen Panayotov</p>

                <p>
                    I am a student at SoftUni and I started studying there because
                    of the free course that was advertised and because of a recommendation 
                    from a friend or two. They know who they are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The free course helped ignite my love for learning coding and I 
                    couldn't be more grateful for being shown something that I very much
                    enjoy doing and studying.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Right now im at the final course of the Web Programming curriculum 
                    and this is my final project for the Project Defense exam.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I very much enjoyed learning python, javascript and programming as a 
                    whole and as I look over this project im pretty happy what all of 
                    my studying and work amounted to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Its the end of the carriculum but Im still eager to learn 
                    lots of new technologies and tools such as React, TypeScript,
                    FastAPI, different types of databases and much more.

                    I haven't been using github a lot since before this project
                    but locally I have a lot of scripts and mini-project I have been
                    doing since starting softuni and I think I will be uploading some
                    on there pretty soon.

                <p>
                    The repository for this project will remain open-source and will
                    be open for PR once the exam is finished.
